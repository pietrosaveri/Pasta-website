# Pasta Converter: Your Ultimate Pasta Portion Calculator
---
**Pasta Converter** is a **React Native** project designed to help users convert pasta portions between two common plate types—**flat plates** and **soup plates**—and pasta weight in grams. Whether you're planning a dinner party or just cooking for yourself, this tool helps you calculate the perfect amount of pasta for your meal, ensuring you serve the right portions every time.

### How It Works

The Pasta Converter works by allowing users to input the number of pasta plates they need or the grams of pasta they plan to cook. Based on the type of plate selected, the app will accurately convert the input into the corresponding grams of pasta or number of plates.
