                <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
                <p>
                    Our site simplifies the process of converting the number of plates of pasta you need into precise grams. We understand that not all plates are created equal, so we've got you covered with two popular plate types: flat plates and soup plates.
                </p>

                <h3>Flat Plates:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ideal for dishes with a flat surface like spaghetti, fettuccine, or linguine.</li>
                    <li>Simply enter the number of flat plates you'd like to serve, and our converter will calculate the corresponding grams of pasta required.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Soup Plates:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed for pasta dishes with more depth, such as penne, rigatoni, or maccheroni.</li>
                    <li>Input the number of soup plates needed, and our converter will provide you with the accurate pasta weight.</li>
                </ul>
